# Roles

## To add a role in a category

Allows you to add a role as administrator or moderator, and you are not limited to one, two or three, well... you can put as many as you want !

```bash
!roles [adminRole/modRole] [add/remove] [mentionRole]
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
The only grade you can't put more than one in is **autoRole**
{% endhint %}

Oh boy... by joining the waiter Michel didn't get his rank **best person in the world**... how can I?:

```bash
!roles autoRole [mentionRole]
```
