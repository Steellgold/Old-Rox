# Channels

![](../.gitbook/assets/image.png)



If you want to send messages, when a member joins your server:

```bash
!channels [joinquit/logs/rox] [mentionChannel]O
```

{% hint style="info" %}
The channel **rox** receive messages from the bot's development team, update announcements, fixes, and a lot of useful information
{% endhint %}

If you 

{% code title="hello.sh" %}
```bash
# Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```
{% endcode %}
